# Into to Party Hub 

Party Hub is an application that allows a user to plan, organize and RSVP to an event. 

When a user visits uses our app, they can view a start a party or view a party. A user that is RSVP-ing to a party, can enter their name and what party favor they will be bringing. A user that has planned a party can enter the party name, location, date and time. 

Users can choose from the three categories of food, beverage or party favor then enter in the name of their item. In addition they can review the app and edit the item they wish to bring. This information is then posted on the party page. 

When a party is created, it will have it's own page where attendees can view the party information, who will be attending and what each attendee will be bringing. 


That app will store the party information, the users and the party favors in databases.
